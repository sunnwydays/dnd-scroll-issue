Displays if u get CE or ee
Displays any minor or cert
Displays if you graduate (make sure you get your 600 hours technical XP or pey)
minors: AM, AI, BE, BM, EB, EE, GL, MP, NE, RM, SE
certs: AI, CM, EV, EB, EL, EN, FE, GE, JE, MR, MT, NE, PH, PP, RR
not doing minors /certs or kernel now (for later maybe)

pECE102|euont,

More courses at the end for extra courses taken in first 2 years

Warnings:
- make sure you have kernels
- make sure you have something from science/math
- check for exclusions (if you took another similar you may not be able take another course, like ECE295 and ECE302)
- make sure you have PEY / 600 hours technical xp
- checking for minors/certifications is only by NJ  number of courses (6 for minor, 3 for cert), check that you fulfill these categories
- double check prereqs if you are missing a lower year (years 1-2) ece course
- check minors on your own

future:
- google oauth login
- store stuff in the url
- localStorage to store in the browser
